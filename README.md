# Mind Restaking Smart Contracts

Solidity smart contracts designed for the Mind network, enabling users to restake their LRT/LST tokens.

## Description

This project consists of Solidity smart contracts that facilitate users in restaking their LRT (Liquid Restaking Tokens) and LST (Liquid Staking Tokens) to the Mind network. The purpose of these contracts is to enhance network security by allowing token holders to actively participate in network operations through restaking.

## Features

- **Restaking Capability**: Users can restake LRT and LST tokens to contribute to network security.
- **Solidity Implementation**: Implemented using Solidity, ensuring compatibility with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.
